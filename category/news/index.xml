&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="presentations-and-demos">Presentations and demos!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The kick-off of the hackathon featured a series of introductions and presentations. Wei Ouyang, the leader of the newly founded AICell Lab, presented a compelling overview of his team’s work, including the development of &lt;a href="https://github.com/amun-ai/hypha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hypha&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/bioengine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioEngine&lt;/a> which serves as a robust platform for running AI models in the cloud and &lt;a href="https://forum.image.sc/t/ai-assisted-bioimage-analysis-with-openai-codex/62045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a large language model-based tool for code generation in image analysis&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next up, the &lt;a href="https://www.piximi.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piximi&lt;/a> team impressed the attendees with their demonstration of how AI models can be run in a web browser using JavaScript, showcasing a powerful annotation tool for bioimage analysis. Not to be outdone, the &lt;a href="https://www.apeer.com/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APEER&lt;/a> platform revealed its latest feature for training AI models and subsequent local downloads for inference.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-talkathon">The “talkathon”&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Initially, the hackathon resembled a “talkathon”, with participants passionately engaging in dynamic discussions, creating synergy and forming interest groups. These conversations traversed a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from enhancing the usability of client tools, supporting custom pre/postprocessing (like StarDist or Cellpose), and even complex inference modes such as test-time augmentation. The consensus was achieved by proposing an ‘ops’ registry — a GitHub repository that stores dependencies and entry point codes for running custom bioimage analysis operations. In essence, this would create a library of operations that could be linked to each model in the BMZ, with each model potentially having multiple operations.&lt;/p>

The lab’s ambition is to create a large-scale human cell simulator powered by massive AI models and automated microscopy imaging farms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do you think your expertise can contribute to the program?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given the current advancements in AI, particularly the significant progress in generative modelling like chatGPT and Diffusion models, I see enormous potential for applying these foundational models to data-driven life sciences in a fully data-driven manner. Translating the successes from natural language processing and computer vision to life sciences requires a deep understanding of the methods, as well as highly interdisciplinary expertise in AI, data science, and biology, among other areas. It demands not only innovation in data analysis but also in data generation. My experience in robotic systems, AI-powered advanced microscopy, image and multi-omics data analysis, data-driven whole-cell modelling, open-source AI tool development, and online data sharing and AI model serving platforms makes me well-suited to contribute to these efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to my technical expertise, I strongly believe in the importance of open-source software development and community engagement in scientific research. I have been actively involved in creating and sharing tools that make deep learning more accessible to researchers, as well as promoting open and reproducible scientific tools. My experience in community building and leadership will be invaluable in driving and reforming the data-driven life science program, fostering collaboration, and accelerating progress in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Shortly describe your research in an easy to understand way.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My research focuses on creating a “black-box” human cell simulator using powerful AI models. This ambitious project involves developing autonomous systems to collect massive amounts of high-quality data for AI training, including building a fully automated imaging farm. By running AI models in real-time, we create a self-driving imaging and cell experimentation system, which allows us to optimize experimental conditions and capture rare cellular events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, our goal is to develop a human cell simulator that unlocks the potential for in-silico cell experimentation, drug discovery, and fosters a holistic understanding of human cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do you think the program and interactions with the other DDLS-Fellows will benefit you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DDLS program is a visionary investment in the next generation of life science and offers a fantastic starting package to build a community that pioneers the future of the field. Being a part of this program has given me the incredible opportunity to establish my own research group.&lt;/p>

The program also serves as a platform for expanding my network of collaborations and learning new skills from experts both within and outside the program. I believe that, in the future, we will see even more coordinated efforts to shape data-driven life sciences through these valuable connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Name one thing that people generally do not know about you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout my studies, I developed a fascination for computational philosophy and the view of the universe as a giant computer. The concept of emergent behaviour from the iterative evaluation of simple rules, similar to how cells in biology and large language models in AI function, particularly intrigued me. This has inspired my passion for developing a human cell simulator, as it presents a unique and exciting opportunity to delve into the underlying rules governing cellular behaviour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Where do you see yourself in five years regarding the DDLS aspect?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In five years, I envision myself having established a robust framework for data-driven whole-cell simulation, contributing significantly&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In one word, describe how you feel about becoming a DDLS-Fellow.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
