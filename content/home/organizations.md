            <h4>Science for Life Laboratory</h4>
            Our lab is located in the Science for Life Laboratory,
            a national center for molecular biosciences with focus on health 
            and environmental research. 
            SciLifeLab has been created by the coordinated effort of four universities 
            in Stockholm and Uppsala: Stockholm University, Karolinska Institutet, 
            KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Uppsala University.
