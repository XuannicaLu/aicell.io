Title:  Doctoral Student in Cell Biology and Computational Microscopy Imaging

**Application Deadline: 22.Feb.2023**

KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm has grown to become one of Europe's leading technical and engineering universities, as well as a key centre of intellectual talent and innovation. We are Sweden's largest technical research and learning institution and home to students, researchers and faculty from around the world. Our research and education covers a wide area including natural sciences and all branches of engineering, as well as architecture, industrial management, urban planning, history and philosophy.

### Project description

Third-cycle subject: Biological Physics

The Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) is a national center for molecular biosciences with focus on health and environmental research. The combination of the highly interdisciplinary expertise and research projects at the department is unique in Sweden and also at an international level. This expertise ranges across cell biology, biochemistry, biophysics and theory. Recently, the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program started the [Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) program](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/) in order to accelerate life science research through innovations in AI and data science.

The AICell Lab (<https://aicell.io>) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and SciLifeLab is a new research group funded by the DDLS Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now opening a position for a doctoral student in biological physics with a focus on cell biology, automation and AI-augmented microscopy imaging.

Whole-cell modeling enables a holistic and quantitative view of cell biology and allows performing in-silico experimentation which has a great potential in revolutionizing system biology, synthetic biology, medicine and other applications in life science. However, modeling the entire cell is an extremely complex task and is heavily limited by our understanding of the biological systems. As a newly formed research group, we would like to take the grand challenge of modeling the human cell through recent advances in artificial intelligence and multi-omics data generation. To enable large-scale AI and data-driven whole cell modeling, we are currently building a smart microscopy imaging farm to ramp up the production rate of image data. The imaging farm consists of multiple microscopes and fluidic systems, robotic arms, liquid handling robots and automatic incubators. The farm will be used for performing automated brightfield/fluorescence imaging, long-term live cell imaging, tracking,  spatial-omics and multiplexing imaging. For the whole-cell modeling project, we aim to build an AI-powered automated imaging system to actively detect, monitor and track the live human cells under drug and genetic perturbations. We would like to develop AI models which read changes in cell morphology and fluorescence markers, to generate control signals for driving the microscope, capture rare events and create balanced dataset for modeling.

You will be responsible for actively and effectively designing and implementing wet lab experiments in the imaging farm, including cell culture, sample preparation and microscopy imaging. Importantly, you will also actively work with other researchers in the group to develop and adapt protocols for the automated imaging farm and AI models. Besides wet lab skills, you will elaborate on your computational skills, e.g., by writing Python scripts to control the imaging farm, train AI models and develop automated data analysis workflows. In later stages of the project you will also design and conduct additional, custom validation experiments, which may involve different molecular biology techniques.

Supervision: Professor Hjalmar Brismar and Assistant Professor Wei Ouyang are proposed to supervise the doctoral student. Decisions are made on admission.
