Title:  Postdoc in Cell Biology and Microscopy Imaging

**Application Open (Deadline: August 24th, 2023)**

### Job description
The AICell Lab (https://aicell.io) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and Science for Life Laboratory is a new research group funded by the Data-driven Life Science Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now opening a position for a postdoctoral researcher in cell biology and computational microscopy imaging. The aim is to develop wet lab protocols and analysis workflows for an AI-powered automated imaging system to actively detect, monitor and track the live human cells under drug and genetic perturbations.  The project is supported by the WASP DDLS collaboration, and in close collaboration with the Jaldén group at KTH and the Lundberg group under the Human Protein Atlas, which is a unique world-leading effort to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues, and organs in the human body.


You will be responsible for actively and effectively designing, implementing, and optimizing wet lab experiments for the self-driving microscope, including cell culture, sample preparation and microscopy imaging. Importantly, you will also actively work with other researchers in the group to develop and optimize protocols for the automated imaging system and AI models. Besides wet lab skills, you will get the opportunity to elaborate on your computational skills, e.g., by writing Python scripts to control the imaging farm, train AI models and develop automated data analysis workflows. In later stages of the project you will also design and conduct additional, custom validation experiments, which may involve different molecular biology techniques.

### What we offer 

-   A position at a leading technical university that generates knowledge and skills for a sustainable future.

-   Engaged and ambitious colleagues along with a creative, international and dynamic working environment

-   Works in Stockholm, in close proximity to nature

-   Collaboration opportunities with leading research institutions and universities in Europe and the US

-   Learning and thriving in a young and ambitious research group

-   Help to[ relocate and be settled in Sweden and at KTH](https://www.kth.se/en/om/work-at-kth/relocation).

### Qualifications

#### Requirements

-   A doctoral degree or an equivalent foreign degree, This eligibility requirement must be met no later than the time the employment decision is made.

-   The ability to express yourself in English.

#### Preferred qualifications

During the selection process, candidates will be assessed upon their ability to: 

- work comfortable in an interdisciplinary team,
- have a solid understanding in cell and molecular biology,
- demonstrate prior experience with cell culture, molecular biology, high throughput microscopy imaging and other wet lab skills, preferably experience with automated liquid handlers or similar instruments,
- demonstrate prior experience with developing, establishing, optimizing, and trouble-shootingwet lab protocols,
- cross disciplines, and demonstrate a passion for lab automation, AI and other computational skills,
- demonstrate prior experience in data analysis, experience with programming languages such as Python and R.

Great emphasis will be placed on personal competency

### Trade union representatives

You will find contact information to trade union representatives at [KTH.se](https://intra.kth.se/en/administration/rekrytering/annonsering/fackrepresentanter-1.500898)

### Application

Log into KTH's recruitment system in order to apply to this position. You are responsible to ensure that your application is complete according to the instructions in the ad.

The application must include:

-   CV including relevant professional experience, knowledge and representative publications. Please also provide your Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket etc. handle if possible.

-   Copy of diplomas and grades from your previous university studies. Translations into English or Swedish if the original documents have not been issued in any of these languages.

-   Brief account of why you want to conduct research, your career goal and how they relate to your previous studies and future goals. Max two pages long.

Your complete application must be received by KTH no later than the last day of application, midnight

CET/CEST (Central European Time/Central European Summer Time).

### About the employment

The position offered is for, at the most, two years. There may be possibilities to prolong the employment.

A position as a postdoctoral fellow is a time-limited qualified appointment focusing mainly on research, intended as a first career step after a dissertation.

### Other information

Striving towards gender equality, diversity and equal conditions is both a question of quality for KTH and a given part of our values.\
