Title:  Doctoral Student in Cell Biology and Computational Microscopy Imaging

**Application Deadline: 27.April.2023**

KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm has grown to become one of Europe's leading technical and engineering universities, as well as a key centre of intellectual talent and innovation. We are Sweden's largest technical research and learning institution and home to students, researchers and faculty from around the world. Our research and education covers a wide area including natural sciences and all branches of engineering, as well as architecture, industrial management, urban planning, history and philosophy.

### Project description

Third-cycle subject: Biological Physics

The AICell Lab (https://aicell.io) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and Science for Life Laboratory is a new research group funded by the Data-driven Life Science Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now opening a position for a doctoral student in biological physics with a focus on robotics and AI-powered microscopy imaging.

You will actively contribute to the design and implementation of an automated microscopy imaging farm, encompassing hardware integration, optics optimization, robotics engineering, and automation systems development. Additionally, you will be involved in developing cutting-edge AI models for data analysis, designing real-time feedback control systems for active data acquisition, and working on data-driven whole-cell modeling initiatives to advance our research objectives.


Supervision: Professor Hjalmar Brismar and Assistant Professor Wei Ouyang are proposed to supervise the doctoral student. Decisions are made on admission.

### What we offer
-------------

-   The possibility to study in a dynamic and international research environment in collaboration with industries and prominent universities from all over the world. [Read more](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/phd/why-1.521017)
