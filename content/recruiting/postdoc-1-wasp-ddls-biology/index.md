Title:  Postdoc in Cell Biology and Computational Microscopy Imaging

**Application Closed (Deadline: 22.Feb.2023)**

### Job description

The Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) is a national center for molecular biosciences with focus on health and environmental research. The combination of the highly interdisciplinary expertise and research projects at the department is unique in Sweden and also at an international level. This expertise ranges across cell biology, biochemistry, biophysics and theory. Recently, the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program started the [Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) program](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/) in order to accelerate life science research through innovations in AI and data science.

The AICell Lab (<https://aicell.io>) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and SciLifeLab is a new research group funded by the DDLS Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now looking for highly motivated candidates to fill a 2-year postdoc position under the [WASP-DDLS collaboration](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/wasp-collaboration/).

The aim of the project is to develop an AI-powered self-driving microscopy system for studying cellular response under genetic and environmental stressors. The project will also be supported by the WASP-DDLS collaboration, and closely collaborate with the Jaldén group at KTH. The Jaldén group has rich experience in computer vision and automatic control systems. The work will also be supported by the Lundberg group under the Human Protein Atlas, which is a unique world-leading effort to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues, and organs in the human body. By joining the force with the Jaldén group and Lundberg group, we would like to develop an AI-powered imaging system to continuously monitor, actively acquire and track human cells under different cellular and environmental stressors. The data will be used to train large-scale AI models to study cellular responses and make predictions for cell fate.

You will be responsible for actively and effectively designing, implementing, and optimizing  wet lab experiments for the self-driving microscope, including cell culture, sample preparation and microscopy imaging. Importantly, you will also actively work with other researchers in the group to develop and optimize protocols for the automated imaging system and AI models. Besides wet lab skills, you will get the opportunity to elaborate on your computational skills, e.g., by writing Python scripts to control the imaging farm, train AI models and develop automated data analysis workflows. In later stages of the project you will also design and conduct additional, custom validation experiments, which may involve different molecular biology techniques.

### What we offer 

-   A position at a leading technical university that generates knowledge and skills for a sustainable future.

-   Engaged and ambitious colleagues along with a creative, international and dynamic working environment

-   Works in Stockholm, in close proximity to nature

-   Collaboration opportunities with leading research institutions and universities in Europe and the US

-   Learning and thriving in a young and ambitious research group

-   Help to[ relocate and be settled in Sweden and at KTH](https://www.kth.se/en/om/work-at-kth/relocation).

-   clearly present scientific concepts and data,

-   work comfortable in an interdisciplinary team,

-   have a professional approach,

-   analyse and work with complex issues,

-   have a solid understanding in cell and molecular biology,

-   demonstrate prior experience with cell culture, molecular biology, high throughput microscopy imaging and other wet lab skills, preferably experience with automated liquid handlers or similar instruments,

-   demonstrate prior experience with developing, establishing, optimizing, and trouble-shootingwet lab protocols,

-   cross disciplines, and demonstrate a passion for lab automation, AI and other computational skills,

-   demonstrate prior experience in programming languages such as Python and R.

-   Prior experience in data analysis workflow development and machine learning is beneficial.

Great emphasis will be placed on personal competency
