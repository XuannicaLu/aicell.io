Title:  Postdoc in AI-powered Whole-cell Modeling

**Application Deadline: 22.Feb.2023**

### Job description

The Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) is a national center for molecular biosciences with focus on health and environmental research. The combination of the highly interdisciplinary expertise and research projects at the department is unique in Sweden and also at an international level. This expertise ranges across cell biology, biochemistry, biophysics and theory. Recently, the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program started the [Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) program](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/) in order to accelerate life science research through innovations in AI and data science.

The AICell Lab (<https://aicell.io>) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and SciLifeLab is a new research group funded by the DDLS Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now seeking two postdoctoral researchers to build AI systems for spatial multi-omics data analysis and whole-cell modeling.

Whole-cell modeling enables a holistic and quantitative view of cell biology and allows performing in-silico experimentation which has a great potential in revolutionizing system biology, synthetic biology, medicine and other applications in life science. However, modeling the entire cell is an extremely complex task and is heavily limited by our understanding of the biological systems. As a newly formed research group, we would like to take the grand challenge of modeling the human cell through recent advances in multi-omics data generation and artificial intelligence. Our aim is to use recent deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks, transformers, AlphaFold and diffusion models to analysis existing multi-omics dataset, combining them with massive amount of newly generated live cell, multiplexed images, to model cellular behavior through generative and predictive models.

The candidates are expected to 1) develop machine learning models and tools for smart microscopy and image analysis 2) integrate multi-omics dataset 3) perform generative modeling and 4) create large-scale differentiable models to do spatial cell simulations. The project will be carried out on top of existing work and collaborate closely with PhDs and postdocs in the group.

### What we offer 

-   A position at a leading technical university that generates knowledge and skills for a sustainable future.

-   Engaged and ambitious colleagues along with a creative, international and dynamic working environment

-   Works in Stockholm, in close proximity to nature

-   Collaboration opportunities with leading research institutions and universities in Europe and the US

-   Learning and thriving in a young and ambitious research group

-   Help to[ relocate and be settled in Sweden and at KTH](https://www.kth.se/en/om/work-at-kth/relocation).

### Trade union representatives

You will find contact information to trade union representatives at [KTH.se](https://intra.kth.se/en/administration/rekrytering/annonsering/fackrepresentanter-1.500898)

### Application

Log into KTH's recruitment system in order to apply to this position. You are responsible to ensure that your application is complete according to the instructions in the ad.

The application must include:

-   CV including relevant professional experience, knowledge and representative publications. Please also provide your Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket etc. handle if possible.

-   Copy of diplomas and grades from your previous university studies. Translations into English or Swedish if the original documents have not been issued in any of these languages.

-   Brief account of why you want to conduct research, your career goal and how they relate to your previous studies and future goals. Max two pages long.

Your complete application must be received by KTH no later than the last day of application, midnight

CET/CEST (Central European Time/Central European Summer Time).

### About the employment

The position offered is for, at the most, two years. There may be possibilities to prolong the employment.

A position as a postdoctoral fellow is a time-limited qualified appointment focusing mainly on research, intended as a first career step after a dissertation.

### Other information

Striving towards gender equality, diversity and equal conditions is both a question of quality for KTH and a given part of our values.\
