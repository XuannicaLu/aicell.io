Title:  Postdoc in Scalable AI Systems for BioImage Analysis

### Job description

[AI4Life](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/) is an EU funded project which aims to empower life science researchers to harness the full potential of AI and machine learning methods for bioimage analysis. As one of the leading partners in the consortium, we are hiring a postdoctoral researcher at the department of applied physics, KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

The postdoc will join a newly formed research group led by [Wei Ouyang](https://oeway.github.io/) and work with other AI4Life consortium partners to build scalable AI tools and computing infrastructure for bioimage analysis. There are two aims in the project: 1) Creating web services and computing platforms for sharing AI models, making them more accessible and usable; 2) Building scalable bioimage analysis methods and tools for powering next-generation [augmented microscopy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418304562). This includes creating tools for collaborative and interactive annotation, model training, real-time inference and generating feedback signal for microscope control.

The candidates are expected to collaborate with other AI4Life partners and develop scalable AI methods, tools and platforms on top of our prior work such as the [BioImage Model Zoo](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.07.495102v1) and [ImJoy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0627-0).

### What we offer 

-   A position at a leading technical university that generates knowledge and skills for a sustainable future.

-   Engaged and ambitious colleagues along with a creative, international and dynamic working environment

-   Works in Stockholm, in close proximity to nature

-   Collaboration opportunities with leading research institutions and universities in Europe and the US

-   Learning and thriving in a young and ambitious research group

-   Help to[ relocate and be settled in Sweden and at KTH](https://www.kth.se/en/om/work-at-kth/relocation).
