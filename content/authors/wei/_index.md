Hi, I'm Wei Ouyang! I work as an assistant professor in the Applied Physics Department at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden. I'm also thrilled to be a [Data-Driven Life Science fellow](https://www.scilifelab.se/research/?filter=all#DDlsfellows). Right now, I'm leading a team that's super excited about building AI systems to power next-generation life science.

I earned my PhD at [Institut Pasteur](https://www.pasteur.fr/en) in Paris, where I transit my career from engineering to life science. I had a blast applying deep learning to advanced microscopy. The highlight? Creating a deep learning method named [ANNA-PALM](https://imod.pages.pasteur.fr/anna-palm-web/) that boosts super-resolution microscopy speed by a whopping 100x!

After my PhD, I spent four great years as a postdoc with [Emma Lundberg](https://biox.stanford.edu/people/emma-lundberg)'s group. During that time, I focused mainly on image analysis method development and whole-cell modeling using generative AI models. I led the analysis for the [Human Protein Atlas Image Classification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/human-protein-atlas-image-classification) on Kaggle and participate in the design of the [HPA Single Cell Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/hpa-single-cell-image-classification). We gathered AI experts from around the globe to tackle these image analysis tasks.

I am a strong supporter of open science! I'm the founder of [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io), an open-source platform designed to make deep learning tools super user-friendly. I'm all in for making science more open, scalable, and accessible, which is why I co-founded the [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io) initiative and [the AI4Life consortium](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/) to share AI models in bioimage analysis.

I'm enthusiastic about AI-augmented microscopy imaging and data-driven whole-cell modeling. The future in these areas is so promising, and I can't wait to see where we go next.

Feel like chatting? I'd love to hear from you!
