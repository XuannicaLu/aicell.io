Hi, I'm Konrad. I grew up in Poland and lived in Malmoe before moving to Stockholm to study at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Initially, I considered a career in medicine, but 
my interest in technology and its application in health-related fields led me to engineering with a focus on life sciences.

Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong passion for healthtech and life science technologies in general. I've had the opportunity to work in health tech, where I led 
projects that focused on remote patient monitoring and product development. I also co-founded a startup that developed a digital platform for remote health services and was part of 
the Norrsken Foundation. My involvement as a member allowed me to connect with like-minded individuals who are passionate about social impact and innovation.

Outside of work, I enjoy football, skiing, and golf, and I'm always looking for new places to explore.

At AICell Lab, I'm excited to work on developing a smart microscopy imaging system that will contribute to the growing field of cellular biology, focusing on automation, live-cell 
imaging, and spatial-omics. My goal is to contribute to advancing life sciences and help push the boundaries of what's possible in biotech research.
