Hi, I am Linh, I earned a PhD in Life Sciences from the University of Greifswald, Germany. After graduating, I conducted research and lectured in Vietnam. My research has spanned across bacterial virulence factors, bacterial physiology, microbiome studies, human genetics, bioinformatics, and cell biology. Additionally, I have a keen interest in machine learning, especially deep learning techniques for image recognition, classification, and object detection. More recently, I have been focusing on applying generative artificial intelligence, specifically Stable Diffusion models, to tackle challenges in molecular and cell biology. Under the mentorship of Prof. Wei at AI Cell Lab, I aim to conduct wet-lab work related to cell imaging and leverage cutting-edge AI technologies in life sciences.
