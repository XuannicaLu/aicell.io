Hi üëã I'm Jeremy. I was born in Germany but grew up in Wales, attending Amman Valley Comprehensive School. My passion for Physics and Computing started early. I pursued an MSci Physics degree at Imperial College London, followed by a PhD in Quantum Computing and Quantum Optics at the same institution.

My academic journey took me to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York for a Post-Doctoral position, focusing on biophysical simulations and image processing. I then served as a Research Software Engineer at the University of Exeter in the UK, where my work involved a range of projects, from organelle detection to bat tracking in IR video feeds.

For the last couple of years, I've been a freelance developer, mainly focusing on image analysis. My primary development language has been Python, but I've also started using Rust for its speed and memory-safety features.

Here at AICell Lab, I aim to leverage my skills to improve our toolsets, contribute to the open-source community, and deepen my understanding of AI technologies.
