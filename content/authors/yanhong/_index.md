Hailing from the sultry south of China, Su, our protagonist, has weathered the sauna-like conditions of her hometown with a remarkably laid-back attitude. Let's be honest â€“ her planning skills might not win awards, but who needs a meticulously crafted plan when you're on an epic adventure?

When Su initially waltzed into the world of medicine, it wasn't a grand love affair. She navigated the medical realm with a laissez-faire spirit, surprising even herself by charting a course all the way to a Ph.D. â€“ a destination far beyond the modest ambitions she harbored at the outset.

After her master degree in oncology, she got a wild idea: "I want to see snow!" So, off she went to Karolinska Institutet for a Ph.D. in Immunology. Now, picture this: a Guangzhou girl facing the Nordic winter like a warrior. Snow, darkness, and Su â€“ a trilogy that could rival Game of Thrones. Spoiler alert: Su survives.

Su has known tumor for a long time, although they are not friends. She learns deep in tumor microenvironment, trying to decode the secret conversations tumors have with their surroundings. It's like eavesdropping on the juiciest gossip in the cellular world.

Now, as if decoding the body's secrets wasn't cool enough, Su's setting her sights on the tech side of life. Not deep into coding, mind you â€“ more like dipping her toes into the pool of machine learning and AI. It's like going from hot pot in Guangzhou to hot code in Sweden.
