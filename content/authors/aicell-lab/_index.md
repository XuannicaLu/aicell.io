The AICell Lab is a newly formed research group at [Science for Life Laboratory](#about-scilifelab) and [KTH Royal Institute at Technology](#about-kth). The group is led by [Wei Ouyang](https://oeway.github.io) and funded by the [Data-Driven Life Science program](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/). The aim of the lab is to build AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology.

**ðŸ‘‹ We are recruiting Ph.D students and postdocs, [check it out](/recruiting)!**
