Hi, I'm Marcus. 

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science with a focus on computer graphics and artificial intelligence. I have hands-on experience with low-level graphics programming using OpenGL and a deep understanding of data structures and AI techniques, including behavior trees, genetic algorithms, and neural networks. Iâ€™m passionate about advancing technology and exploring its potential.

I will be exploring how to transform the AI training process, which currently involves manual input from humans, into a more engaging and user-friendly application. Specifically, Iâ€™m focusing on creating an app that makes it enjoyable for users to provide feedback on AI-generated image selections, helping to refine and improve the AIâ€™s accuracy in a fun and interactive way.
