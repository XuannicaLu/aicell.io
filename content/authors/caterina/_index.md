Greetings, I'm Caterina!

As a Post-doctoral researcher affiliated with the BSEL group at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M), my academic journey is an exciting exploration of biomedical science and engineering. My research mentor is Dra. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia, and together, we delve into the captivating world of biomedicine.

My current endeavor revolves around the groundbreaking AI4Life project, a visionary initiative generously funded by the Horizon Europe Work Program. This collaborative endeavor assembles 10 leading partners from 8 countries and boasts a dedicated 3-year, 4 million EUR investment. Through AI4Life, our mission is to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence within the life sciences domain.

Beyond AI4Life, I'm deeply passionate about various bioimage analysis projects, specializing in microscopy, histopathology, and magnetic resonance.

Last year marked a significant milestone in my academic journey when I defended my PhD thesis with distinction. My research centered on the intriguing intersection of cybersecurity and biometrics, specifically the identification of individuals using Electrocardiogram signals transformed into images.

Through my online presence, I aspire to share my wealth of knowledge, experiences, and discoveries with the global scientific community. Join me on this thrilling expedition as we explore the frontiers of biomedical research.

Please don't hesitate to get in touch, collaborate, or delve deeper into my work and interests.
