Hi there! I’m Gabe. I grew up in San Francisco but have hopped around a bit. I’ve lived on the US coasts before and Sweden for the last few years. I’m deeply excited to be here at the AICell Lab.

After leaving home, I studied computer science and applied mathematics at university before completing a PhD in bioengineering at Stanford University. During my graduate studies, I worked on computational metabolomics in Michael Fischbach’s group focusing on mass spectrometry data. It was invigorating to apply computational techniques to an applied area of biology (the gut microbiome), and it was during this time that I began to fall in love with automated experimental scientific discovery and laboratory robotics learning from the history of the Dendral project. I later moved to Gothenburg, Sweden and worked on robot scientists in Ross King’s group at Chalmers University. 

I’m always excited to find new ways of applying core tools from computer science, math, and software engineering to ease the process of making new discoveries. And it’s a treat to work in biology where new findings can dramatically improve quality of life for so many. During my time at Chalmers I explored these ideas further working on robot scientists, automating ion mobility mass spectrometry, running lab robots, and applying automated reasoning approaches to extracting information from robotic assays.

 I’m fascinated by the idea of using a combination of laboratory robotics, analytical instrumentation, simulation, and computation to change the way we conduct research in the lab! I believe strongly in open science and am always looking for creative ways to tackle challenging problems in the life sciences. My previous work with mass spectrometry has taught me the power of rich analytical measurement in the lab, and so I'm especially excited to work with high-throughput microscopy data in the AICell Lab. I love being exposed to new fields and tools so feel free to reach out with interesting directions anytime.
