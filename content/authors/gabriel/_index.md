Hi there! Iâ€™m Gabe. I grew up in San Francisco but have hopped around a bit, living on the US coasts and in Sweden for the last few years. Iâ€™m deeply excited to be here at the AICell Lab.

After leaving home, I studied computer science and applied mathematics at university before completing a PhD in bioengineering at Stanford University. During my graduate studies, I worked in Michael Fischbachâ€™s group focusing on computational metabolomics and mass spectrometry data. I later moved to Gothenburg, Sweden and worked on robot scientists in Ross Kingâ€™s group at Chalmers University.

Iâ€™m always excited to find new ways of applying core tools from computer science, math, and software engineering to make new discoveries. During my time at Chalmers, I explored automating ion mobility mass spectrometry, running lab robots, and applying automated reasoning approaches. Iâ€™m fascinated by the idea of using laboratory robotics, analytical instrumentation, simulation, and computation to change how we conduct research. I strongly believe in open science and am excited to work with high-throughput microscopy data here at AICell Lab.
