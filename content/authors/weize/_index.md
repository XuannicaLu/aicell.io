I began my undergraduate studies in Veterinary Medicine at Huazhong Agricultural University. It was during this time that I discovered a keen interest in bioinformatics and embarked on a self-directed journey into programming. To further hone my skills, I also pursued a second bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Wuhan University.

For my master's program, I joined Professor Gang Cao's lab at Huazhong Agricultural University. There, I delved into bioinformatics analyses related to 3D genomics. To enhance the efficiency of my research, I developed software tools such as CoolBox and DLO Hi-C Tools. Notably, CoolBox received substantial positive feedback upon its release as an open-source tool.

As I progressed into my PhD, my research focus pivoted towards the development of novel techniques in spatial transcriptomics. My primary task involved decoding spatial gene expression patterns from intricate microscope imagery. To overcome the associated challenges, I created ImgFlow, a Python-based image processing software that utilizes a node editor, and U-FISH, a deep learning algorithm designed for detecting FISH signals.

While exploring various image processing software options, I came across ImJoy, developed by Professor Wei Ouyang. I was particularly drawn to its excellent design and functionality. Intrigued, I reached out to Professor Ouyang online and subsequently learned about the AI Cell Lab project. Recognizing the enormous potential of this initiative, I made the decision to join AI Cell Lab as a visiting PhD student. I am excited to collaborate and grow alongside Professor Ouyang and the rest of the team.
