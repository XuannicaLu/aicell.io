## What's New? 🆕
The chatbot is no ordinary assistant. It's supercharged with an external knowledge base that's constantly updated with the latest developer documentation, tools, and more. This means you get real-time, accurate information without waiting for periodic model retraining. 🔄

## How Does It Work? 🛠
For a sneak peek at what the BioImage.IO Chatbot can do, check out our gallery of examples: [Usage Examples](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimageio-chatbot/blob/main/docs/usage-example.md).
