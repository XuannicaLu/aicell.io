We're pleased to announce that Weize Xu will be joining us as a visiting PhD student starting in November. He brings with him a background in bioinformatics and software development.

### Getting to Know Weize

Weize comes to us from Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, China. He has balanced his interests in Veterinary Medicine and Computer Science to explore bioinformatics tools.

Weize has worked on several projects during his academic journey, including developing software tools for bioinformatics analysis. These tools have been well-received in the academic community and have eased the workflow for researchers.

### Synergy with AICell Lab’s Focus Areas

Weize will play a pivotal role in enhancing our existing software tools such as [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io). He will also contribute to the development of visualization tools on top of [Kaibu](https://kaibu.org), and web applications via [BioEngine](https://aicell.io/project/bioengine/) for scalable image analysis. All of these efforts will feed into our [AI4Life project](https://aicell.io/project/ai4life/), which aims to share AI models for the life science community and promote open and reproducible science.
