&lt;p>We would like to take the grand challenge of modeling the human cell and building human cell simulators using powerful AI models. It is an ambitious goal that requires profound innovations in not only data analysis and modeling, but also in data generation. We believe it is crucial for us to build autonomous systems to acquire massive amounts of high quality data that are suitable to train AI models. To this front, we would like to build a fully automated imaging farm which consists of multiple microscopes, robotic arms, liquid handling robots and automatic incubators. Importantly, we run AI models in real-time to augment the microscopy views, generating artificial labels and annotations. It also allows generating feedback signals to or example, control the cell growth, differentiation, and drive the microscope to change field-of-views, illumination power and other experimental conditions in order to optimize the phototoxicity and capture rare events in live cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the long-term goal of the group is to create large-scale whole human cell models trained on existing multi-omics datasets and new data generated by the imaging farm. We envision the human cell models have a great potential in &lt;em>in-silico&lt;/em> cell experimentation, drug discovery and contributing to a holistic and systematic understanding of the human cell.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI4Life - AI Models for BioImaging</title><link>https://aicell.io/project/ai4life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aicell.io/project/ai4life/</guid><description>&lt;p>AI4LIFE is a Horizon Europe-funded project that brings together the computational and life science communities. Its goal is to empower life science researchers to harness the full potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods for bioimage analysis – and in particular microscopy image analysis, by providing services, and developing standards aimed at both developers and users. With a consortium of ten partners, AI4LIFE promises to create harmonized and interoperable AI tools &amp;amp; methods via Open calls and public challenges and bring these developments to researchers via strategic outreach and advanced training. The services provided and solutions developed within the AI4LIFE framework are crucial to solving today’s microscopy image analysis problems and will contribute to boosting the pace of biological and medical insights and discovery in the coming years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more information about the project, check it out at the &lt;a href="https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI4Life website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AICell Lab at KTH is a leading partner in the AI4Life consortium. We focus on supporting the user services and cloud computing infrastructure via BioImage Model Zoo (&lt;a href="https://bioimage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bioimage.io&lt;/a>). The model zoo is a community-driven, fully open resource where standardized pre-trained models can be shared, explored, tested, and downloaded for further adaptation or direct deployment in multiple end user-facing tools (e.g., ilastik, deepImageJ, QuPath, StarDist, ImJoy, ZeroCostDL4Mic, CSBDeep). To enable everyone to contribute and consume the Zoo resources, we provide a model standard to enable cross-compatibility, a rich list of example models and practical use-cases, developer tools, documentation, and the accompanying infrastructure for model upload, download and testing. Our contribution aims to lay the groundwork to make deep learning methods for microscopy imaging findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) across software tools and platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more details about the model zoo, see our publication &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.07.495102v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Human Cell Simulator</title><link>https://aicell.io/project/human-cell-simulator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aicell.io/project/human-cell-simulator/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whole-cell modeling enables a holistic and quantitative view of cell biology and allows performing in-silico experimentation which has a great potential in revolutionizing system biology, synthetic biology, medicine and other applications in life science.

Combined with increasing data repositories in genomics, imaging and other fields, such successes underlay a growing demand to adapt DL methods to new datasets and questions1. However, the dissemination of DL approaches faces considerable hurdles. Most published DL studies2,3,4,5 require users to retrain models on their own data to obtain the best performance and/or avoid erroneous results. Although trained models are frequently available through web applications or ImageJ plugins, retraining is typically only possible via scripts or command lines, rather than graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In addition, the complexities of setting up the required hardware and software environments often constitute forbidding obstacles6. Furthermore, the large datasets and computational resources typical of current DL successes pose challenges to traditional desktop-oriented software that tightly couple GUI and computation. Cloud services can partly alleviate these difficulties, but raise privacy and confidentiality issues that can be prohibitive for medical data7. Meanwhile, deploying scientific software to mobile platforms can make them accessible to billions of people8, enabling large-scale biomedical research and citizen science. These opportunities and challenges call for new computational frameworks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm has grown to become one of Europe&amp;rsquo;s leading technical and engineering universities, as well as a key centre of intellectual talent and innovation. We are Sweden&amp;rsquo;s largest technical research and learning institution and home to students, researchers and faculty from around the world. Our research and education covers a wide area including natural sciences and all branches of engineering, as well as architecture, industrial management, urban planning, history and philosophy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="project-description">Project description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Third-cycle subject: Biological Physics&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) is a national center for molecular biosciences with focus on health and environmental research. The combination of the highly interdisciplinary expertise and research projects at the department is unique in Sweden and also at an international level. This expertise ranges across cell biology, biochemistry, biophysics and theory. Recently, the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program started the &lt;a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) program&lt;/a> in order to accelerate life science research through innovations in AI and data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AICell Lab (&lt;a href="https://aicell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aicell.io&lt;/a>) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and SciLifeLab is a new research group funded by the DDLS Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now opening a position for a doctoral student in biological physics with a focus on cell biology, automation and AI-augmented microscopy imaging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whole-cell modeling enables a holistic and quantitative view of cell biology and allows performing in-silico experimentation which has a great potential in revolutionizing system biology, synthetic biology, medicine and other applications in life science. However, modeling the entire cell is an extremely complex task and is heavily limited by our understanding of the biological systems. As a newly formed research group, we would like to take the grand challenge of modeling the human cell through recent advances in artificial intelligence and multi-omics data generation. To enable large-scale AI and data-driven whole cell modeling, we are currently building a smart microscopy imaging farm to ramp up the production rate of image data. The imaging farm consists of multiple microscopes and fluidic systems, robotic arms, liquid handling robots and automatic incubators. The farm will be used for performing automated brightfield/fluorescence imaging, long-term live cell imaging, tracking,  spatial-omics and multiplexing imaging. For the whole-cell modeling project, we aim to build an AI-powered automated imaging system to actively detect, monitor and track the live human cells under drug and genetic perturbations. We would like to develop AI models which read changes in cell morphology and fluorescence markers, to generate control signals for driving the microscope, capture rare events and create balanced dataset for modeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be responsible for actively and effectively designing and implementing wet lab experiments in the imaging farm, including cell culture, sample preparation and microscopy imaging. Importantly, you will also actively work with other researchers in the group to develop and adapt protocols for the automated imaging farm and AI models. Besides wet lab skills, you will elaborate on your computational skills, e.g., by writing Python scripts to control the imaging farm, train AI models and develop automated data analysis workflows. In later stages of the project you will also design and conduct additional, custom validation experiments, which may involve different molecular biology techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="job-description">Job description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) is a national center for molecular biosciences with focus on health and environmental research. The combination of the highly interdisciplinary expertise and research projects at the department is unique in Sweden and also at an international level. This expertise ranges across cell biology, biochemistry, biophysics and theory. Recently, the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program started the &lt;a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) program&lt;/a> in order to accelerate life science research through innovations in AI and data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AICell Lab (&lt;a href="https://aicell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aicell.io&lt;/a>) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and SciLifeLab is a new research group funded by the DDLS Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now seeking two postdoctoral researchers to build AI systems for spatial multi-omics data analysis and whole-cell modeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whole-cell modeling enables a holistic and quantitative view of cell biology and allows performing in-silico experimentation which has a great potential in revolutionizing system biology, synthetic biology, medicine and other applications in life science. However, modeling the entire cell is an extremely complex task and is heavily limited by our understanding of the biological systems. As a newly formed research group, we would like to take the grand challenge of modeling the human cell through recent advances in multi-omics data generation and artificial intelligence. Our aim is to use recent deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks, transformers, AlphaFold and diffusion models to analysis existing multi-omics dataset, combining them with massive amount of newly generated live cell, multiplexed images, to model cellular behavior through generative and predictive models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The candidates are expected to 1) develop machine learning models and tools for smart microscopy and image analysis 2) integrate multi-omics dataset 3) perform generative modeling and 4) create large-scale differentiable models to do spatial cell simulations. The project will be carried out on top of existing work and collaborate closely with PhDs and postdocs in the group.&lt;/p>

The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now looking for highly motivated candidates to fill a 2-year postdoc position under the &lt;a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/wasp-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WASP-DDLS collaboration&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of the project is to develop an AI-powered self-driving microscopy system for studying cellular response under genetic and environmental stressors. The project will also be supported by the WASP-DDLS collaboration, and closely collaborate with the Jaldén group at KTH. The Jaldén group has rich experience in computer vision and automatic control systems. The work will also be supported by the Lundberg group under the Human Protein Atlas, which is a unique world-leading effort to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues, and organs in the human body. By joining the force with the Jaldén group and Lundberg group, we would like to develop an AI-powered imaging system to continuously monitor, actively acquire and track human cells under different cellular and environmental stressors. The data will be used to train large-scale AI models to study cellular responses and make predictions for cell fate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be responsible for actively and effectively designing, implementing, and optimizing  wet lab experiments for the self-driving microscope, including cell culture, sample preparation and microscopy imaging. Importantly, you will also actively work with other researchers in the group to develop and optimize protocols for the automated imaging system and AI models. Besides wet lab skills, you will get the opportunity to elaborate on your computational skills, e.g., by writing Python scripts to control the imaging farm, train AI models and develop automated data analysis workflows. In later stages of the project you will also design and conduct additional, custom validation experiments, which may involve different molecular biology techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The postdoc will work with other AI4Life consortium partners to build scalable AI tools and computing infrastructure for bioimage analysis. There are two aims in the project: 1) Creating web services and computing platforms for sharing AI models, making them more accessible and usable; 2) Building scalable bioimage analysis methods and tools for powering next-generation augmented microscopy. This includes creating tools for collaborative and interactive annotation, model training, real-time inference and generating feedback signal for microscope control.&lt;/p>
