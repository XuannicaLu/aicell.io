&lt;p>We are absolutely thrilled to announce a milestone in the AICell Lab&amp;rsquo;s journey: the joining of our very first PhD student, &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/authors/songtao">&lt;strong>Songtao Cheng&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, this coming October.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="meet-songtao-our-newest-multidisciplinary-asset">Meet Songtao: Our Newest Multidisciplinary Asset&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a lab deeply committed to interdisciplinary research, we find Songtao to be a perfect fit. His background is a rich tapestry of biological wet lab skills, machine learning, and lab automation. Notably, Songtao honed his skills in both computational and biological realms, evidenced by his participation in two iGEM competitions where he led modeling and experimental aspects.&lt;/p>

It consists of multiple microscopes and fluidic systems, robotic arms, liquid handling robots and automatic incubators. The farm will be used for performing automated widefield/fluorescence imaging, long-term live cell imaging, tracking, spatial-omics and multiplexing imaging. With the AI-powered control software, data are analyzed in real-time, augmented views are added on the fly. By generating feedback control signals to control the microscope, the software will automatically change field-of-views, illumination power and other experimental conditions in order to optimize the phototoxicity and capture rare events in live cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a sketch for our cell lab with the imaging farm:&lt;/p>

The project will also be supported by the WASP-DDLS collaboration, and closely collaborate with the Jaldén group at KTH. The Jaldén group has rich experience in computer vision and automatic control systems. The work will also be supported by the Lundberg group under the Human Protein Atlas, which is a unique world-leading effort to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues, and organs in the human body. By joining the force with the Jaldén group and Lundberg group, we would like to develop an AI-powered imaging system to continuously monitor, actively acquire and track human cells under different cellular and environmental stressors. The data will be used to train large-scale AI models to study cellular responses and make predictions for cell fate.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
