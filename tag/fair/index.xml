Its goal is to empower life science researchers to harness the full potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods for bioimage analysis – and in particular microscopy image analysis, by providing services, and developing standards aimed at both developers and users. With a consortium of ten partners, AI4LIFE promises to create harmonized and interoperable AI tools &amp;amp; methods via Open calls and public challenges and bring these developments to researchers via strategic outreach and advanced training. The services provided and solutions developed within the AI4LIFE framework are crucial to solving today’s microscopy image analysis problems and will contribute to boosting the pace of biological and medical insights and discovery in the coming years.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The AICell Lab at KTH is a leading partner in the AI4Life consortium. We focus on supporting the user services and cloud computing infrastructure via BioImage Model Zoo (&lt;a href="https://bioimage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bioimage.io&lt;/a>). The model zoo is a community-driven, fully open resource where standardized pre-trained models can be shared, explored, tested, and downloaded for further adaptation or direct deployment in multiple end user-facing tools (e.g., ilastik, deepImageJ, QuPath, StarDist, ImJoy, ZeroCostDL4Mic, CSBDeep). To enable everyone to contribute and consume the Zoo resources, we provide a model standard to enable cross-compatibility, a rich list of example models and practical use-cases, developer tools, documentation, and the accompanying infrastructure for model upload, download and testing. Our contribution aims to lay the groundwork to make deep learning methods for microscopy imaging findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) across software tools and platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more details about the model zoo, see our publication &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.07.495102v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BioEngine - AI- &amp; Web-powered Image Analysis</title><link>https://aicell.io/project/bioengine/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aicell.io/project/bioengine/</guid><description>&lt;p>The increasingly amount of data generated in life science poses challenges in managing and analysis. The conventional approach for storing and processing scientific data locally on workstations or laptops is failing to met modern needs in applications such as AI-powered image analysis. We would like to tackle the challenge by introducing the BioEngine platform, which is a computational platform consists of containerized services for scalable data management and AI model serving. It is a web platform built on top of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/amun-ai/hypha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hypha&lt;/a> with an emphasis on serving models for bioimage analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this project, we aim to develop web services for providing flexible image data management solutions and also model serving in the cloud (private or public). The BioEngine is being used to support the test run feature in the &lt;a href="https://bioimage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioImage Model Zoo&lt;/a> website (also see the &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/ai4life">AI4Life project&lt;/a>). We aim to provide deployment toolkit for users to setup their own server, either in an institutional Kubernetes cluster or a workstation. Under the AI4Life project, we aim to provide a standard for managing and sharing image data together with the &lt;a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioImage Archive&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To learn more technial details about the BioEngine, please see the tutorial slides &lt;a href="https://slides.imjoy.io/?slides=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oeway/slides/master/2022/i2k-2022-bioengine-workshop.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
