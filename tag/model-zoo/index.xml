Its goal is to empower life science researchers to harness the full potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods for bioimage analysis – and in particular microscopy image analysis, by providing services, and developing standards aimed at both developers and users. With a consortium of ten partners, AI4LIFE promises to create harmonized and interoperable AI tools &amp;amp; methods via Open calls and public challenges and bring these developments to researchers via strategic outreach and advanced training. The services provided and solutions developed within the AI4LIFE framework are crucial to solving today’s microscopy image analysis problems and will contribute to boosting the pace of biological and medical insights and discovery in the coming years.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The AICell Lab at KTH is a leading partner in the AI4Life consortium. We focus on supporting the user services and cloud computing infrastructure via BioImage Model Zoo (&lt;a href="https://bioimage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bioimage.io&lt;/a>). The model zoo is a community-driven, fully open resource where standardized pre-trained models can be shared, explored, tested, and downloaded for further adaptation or direct deployment in multiple end user-facing tools (e.g., ilastik, deepImageJ, QuPath, StarDist, ImJoy, ZeroCostDL4Mic, CSBDeep). To enable everyone to contribute and consume the Zoo resources, we provide a model standard to enable cross-compatibility, a rich list of example models and practical use-cases, developer tools, documentation, and the accompanying infrastructure for model upload, download and testing. Our contribution aims to lay the groundwork to make deep learning methods for microscopy imaging findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) across software tools and platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more details about the model zoo, see our publication &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.07.495102v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
