&lt;h2 id="what-will-gabe-work-on-at-the-aicell-lab">What Will Gabe Work On at the AICell Lab?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Gabe will be a key contributor to our cutting-edge automated imaging farm, REEF. The ultimate goal is to create a fully automated, intelligent system that will redefine how we conduct biological imaging. He will explore the integration of large language models like ChatGPT and autonomous agents augmented by specialized knowledge bases. These advanced technologies aim to automate the entire biological imaging workflow, from formulating scientific hypotheses and crafting experimental plans to executing them on our imaging farm. Beyond mere automation, Gabe&amp;rsquo;s work will pave the way for fully autonomous agents capable of data collection and analysis, report generation, and even driving subsequent experiments based on findings. This ambitious project promises to be a cornerstone in our ongoing efforts to revolutionize data-driven life sciences.&lt;/p>

Jeremy will be joining us in October as a Research Engineer. With a rich academic and professional background, he brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise in computer vision, computational biology, and modelling and simulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="meet-jeremy-a-perfect-fit-for-aicell-lab">Meet Jeremy: A Perfect Fit for AICell Lab&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Born in Germany and raised in Wales, Jeremy is an academic polymath with a PhD in Quantum Computing and Quantum Optics from Imperial College London. He brings a tapestry of skills that dovetail seamlessly with AICell Lab&amp;rsquo;s mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His expertise spans from biological image analysis to computational modeling of biological systems, making him an invaluable asset for our multidisciplinary projects. As the former Head of Image Analysis at the University of Exeter, Jeremy made significant contributions to the BioImaging community, notably as a key contributor to the open-source platform, ImageJ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeremy is not just a researcher but also an educator. He has bridged the gap between computational methods and biological research through a series of tutorials and workshops, including popular courses like &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Python, ImageJ, and Python for Data Analysis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His computational skills go beyond image analysis, encompassing parallel computing techniques and modeling of biological systems. These capabilities will be instrumental as AICell Lab scales its projects in areas like automated microscopy and whole-cell modeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="synergy-with-aicell-labs-focus-areas">Synergy with AICell Lab’s Focus Areas&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As a Research Engineer, Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s expertise will be crucial in advancing our computational support in the AICell Lab.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeremy will play a pivotal role in developing software tools to support various AICell Lab projects. These include bioimage analysis, &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/self-driving-microscope">self-driving microscopy&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/reef-imaging-farm">automated microscopy imaging farm&lt;/a>, and the &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/human-cell-simulator">human cell simulator&lt;/a>. He will also contribute to the development of our web and cloud computational frameworks, such as &lt;a href="https://imjoy.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ImJoy&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/bioengine/">BioEngine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeremy will mainly participate in the &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/ai4life/">AI4Life project&lt;/a>, a Horizon Europe-funded initiative aimed at empowering life science researchers with AI and Machine Learning methods for bioimage analysis. His expertise will be instrumental in developing the web-based model repository, &lt;a href="https://bioimage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioImage Model Zoo&lt;/a>, and the accompanying infrastructure for model upload, download, and running AI models in the cloud.&lt;/p>

However, modeling the entire cell is an extremely complex task and is heavily limited by our understanding of the biological systems. As a newly formed research group, we would like to take the grand challenge of building a human cell simulator through recent advances in multi-omics data generation and artificial intelligence. Our aim is to use recent deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks, transformers, AlphaFold and diffusion models to analysis existing multi-omics dataset, combining them with massive amount of newly generated live cell, multiplexed images, to model cellular behavior through generative and predictive models.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
