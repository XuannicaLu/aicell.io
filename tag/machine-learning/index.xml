&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If given the opportunity to dine with a scientist, my choice would be Emmanuelle Charpentier. In 2020, she received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her groundbreaking contributions to CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. Charpentier&amp;rsquo;s unyielding creativity and diligence led to her well-deserved Nobel Prize recognition. I deeply admire her courage, intuitive insights, and steadfast commitment to adhering to empirical evidence, even when it challenged established paradigms. Engaging in a conversation with her would offer a remarkable chance to explore her thoughtful scientific approach, her strategies for overcoming challenges, and her profound insights into genetics and the research process. Undoubtedly, such a dialogue would serve as a wellspring of inspiration for my own scientific pursuits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We are eager to see how Linh&amp;rsquo;s contributions will propel AICell Lab&amp;rsquo;s mission forward. Please join us in giving Linh a warm welcome to the AICell Lab family!&lt;/p>
