Gabe brings a wealth of expertise in computational biology, automated scientific discovery, AI, simulation, lab robotics, and mass spectrometry metabolomics.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="about-gabriel">About Gabriel&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Born and raised in San Francisco, Gabe earned his PhD in Bioengineering from Stanford University, followed by a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from Columbia University and an AB in Computer Science from Princeton University. Prior to joining AICell, he worked at Chalmers University in Sweden, focusing on robotic automation in scientific research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gabe is passionate about the intersection of computational biology and laboratory automation. He aims to use his expertise to ease the process of making new discoveries and improve the quality of life for many. He is especially eager to work with high-throughput microscopy data at AICell Lab.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-will-gabe-work-on-at-the-aicell-lab">What Will Gabe Work On at the AICell Lab?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Gabe will be a key contributor to our cutting-edge automated imaging farm, REEF. The ultimate goal is to create a fully automated, intelligent system that will redefine how we conduct biological imaging. He will explore the integration of large language models like ChatGPT and autonomous agents augmented by specialized knowledge bases. These advanced technologies aim to automate the entire biological imaging workflow, from formulating scientific hypotheses and crafting experimental plans to executing them on our imaging farm. Beyond mere automation, Gabe&amp;rsquo;s work will pave the way for fully autonomous agents capable of data collection and analysis, report generation, and even driving subsequent experiments based on findings. This ambitious project promises to be a cornerstone in our ongoing efforts to revolutionize data-driven life sciences.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hopefully smoothly! I see lots of overlaps between the lab&amp;rsquo;s mission, the expertise of its members, and my background. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few years working on the automation of biology labs, combining AI, informatics, lab robotics, and high-throughput mass spectrometry.&lt;/p>
