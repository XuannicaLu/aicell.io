Jeremy will be joining us in October as a Research Engineer. With a rich academic and professional background, he brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise in computer vision, computational biology, and modelling and simulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="meet-jeremy-a-perfect-fit-for-aicell-lab">Meet Jeremy: A Perfect Fit for AICell Lab&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Born in Germany and raised in Wales, Jeremy is an academic polymath with a PhD in Quantum Computing and Quantum Optics from Imperial College London. He brings a tapestry of skills that dovetail seamlessly with AICell Lab&amp;rsquo;s mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His expertise spans from biological image analysis to computational modeling of biological systems, making him an invaluable asset for our multidisciplinary projects. As the former Head of Image Analysis at the University of Exeter, Jeremy made significant contributions to the BioImaging community, notably as a key contributor to the open-source platform, ImageJ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeremy is not just a researcher but also an educator. He has bridged the gap between computational methods and biological research through a series of tutorials and workshops, including popular courses like &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Python, ImageJ, and Python for Data Analysis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His computational skills go beyond image analysis, encompassing parallel computing techniques and modeling of biological systems. These capabilities will be instrumental as AICell Lab scales its projects in areas like automated microscopy and whole-cell modeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="synergy-with-aicell-labs-focus-areas">Synergy with AICell Lab’s Focus Areas&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As a Research Engineer, Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s expertise will be crucial in advancing our computational support in the AICell Lab.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeremy will play a pivotal role in developing software tools to support various AICell Lab projects. These include bioimage analysis, &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/self-driving-microscope">self-driving microscopy&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/reef-imaging-farm">automated microscopy imaging farm&lt;/a>, and the &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/human-cell-simulator">human cell simulator&lt;/a>. He will also contribute to the development of our web and cloud computational frameworks, such as &lt;a href="https://imjoy.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ImJoy&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/bioengine/">BioEngine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeremy will mainly participate in the &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/ai4life/">AI4Life project&lt;/a>, a Horizon Europe-funded initiative aimed at empowering life science researchers with AI and Machine Learning methods for bioimage analysis. His expertise will be instrumental in developing the web-based model repository, &lt;a href="https://bioimage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioImage Model Zoo&lt;/a>, and the accompanying infrastructure for model upload, download, and running AI models in the cloud.&lt;/p>
