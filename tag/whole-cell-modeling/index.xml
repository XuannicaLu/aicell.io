However, modeling the entire cell is an extremely complex task and is heavily limited by our understanding of the biological systems. As a newly formed research group, we would like to take the grand challenge of building a human cell simulator through recent advances in multi-omics data generation and artificial intelligence. Our aim is to use recent deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks, transformers, AlphaFold and diffusion models to analysis existing multi-omics dataset, combining them with massive amount of newly generated live cell, multiplexed images, to model cellular behavior through generative and predictive models.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
