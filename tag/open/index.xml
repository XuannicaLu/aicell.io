&lt;p>The AICell Lab (&lt;a href="https://aicell.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aicell.io&lt;/a>) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and Science for Life Laboratory is a new research group funded by the Data-driven Life Science Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now opening a position for a research engineer who will work on software development for AI-powered data management and lab automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The research engineer will be responsible for building web-based user interfaces, computational backends, and managing container-based computing clusters. You will have the opportunity to work on exciting projects such as the AI-powered automated imaging farm, which involves robotic and imaging hardware control, experiment planning, and real-time AI-powered data analysis. You will collaborate with teams from Stanford University and develop AI platforms based on our existing open source projects such as &lt;a href="https://imjoy.io/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ImJoy&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/imjoy-team/imagej.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ImageJ.JS&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/bioengine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioEngine&lt;/a>. Additionally, they will work with international consortia such as the EU-supported research infrastructure project &lt;a href="https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI4Life&lt;/a> for building the &lt;a href="https://bioimage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bioimage Model Zoo&lt;/a> and creating cloud-based AI computing infrastructure for deploying AI to research institutions and used by the masses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Responsibilities include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Developing software and web-based user interfaces for AI-powered data management and lab automation&lt;/p>
