&lt;p>&lt;strong>Application Deadline: 10.April.2023&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="job-description">Job description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) is a national center for molecular biosciences with focus on health and environmental research. The combination of the highly interdisciplinary expertise and research projects at the department is unique in Sweden and also at an international level. This expertise ranges across cell biology, biochemistry, biophysics and theory. Recently, the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program started the &lt;a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) program&lt;/a> in order to accelerate life science research through innovations in AI and data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AICell Lab (&lt;a href="https://aicell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aicell.io&lt;/a>) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and SciLifeLab is a new research group funded by the DDLS Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now seeking a postdoctoral researcher to develop AI-powered automated microscopy imaging systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of the project is to build a smart microscopy imaging farm for massive production of image data. It consists of multiple microscopes and fluidic systems, robotic arms, liquid handling robots and automatic incubators. The farm will be used for performing automated widefield/fluorescence imaging, long-term live cell imaging, tracking,  spatial-omics and multiplexing imaging. With the AI-powered control software, data are analyzed in real-time, augmented views are added on the fly. By generating feedback control signals to control the microscope, the software will automatically change field-of-views, illumination power and other experimental conditions in order to optimize the phototoxicity and capture rare events in live cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The candidate is expected to develop an integrated system with microscopes, fluidic control, robotic arms, as well as the control software. The project is a collaboration with our collaborator in the &lt;a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WASP program&lt;/a> and built on top of our prior work (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.28.424613v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squid&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0627-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ImJoy&lt;/a>) from us or our collaborators at Stanford University.&lt;/p>
