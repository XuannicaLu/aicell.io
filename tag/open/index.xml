&lt;h3 id="job-description">Job description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The AICell Lab (&lt;a href="https://aicell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aicell.io&lt;/a>) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and Science for Life Laboratory is a new research group funded by the Data-driven Life Science Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now opening a position for a postdoctoral researcher in cell biology and computational microscopy imaging. The aim is to develop wet lab protocols and analysis workflows for an AI-powered automated imaging system to actively detect, monitor and track the live human cells under drug and genetic perturbations. The project is supported by the WASP DDLS collaboration, and in close collaboration with the Jaldén group at KTH and the Lundberg group under the Human Protein Atlas, which is a unique world-leading effort to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues, and organs in the human body.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be responsible for actively and effectively designing, implementing, and optimizing wet lab experiments for the self-driving microscope, including cell culture, sample preparation and microscopy imaging. Importantly, you will also actively work with other researchers in the group to develop and optimize protocols for the automated imaging system and AI models. Besides wet lab skills, you will get the opportunity to elaborate on your computational skills, e.g., by writing Python scripts to control the imaging farm, train AI models and develop automated data analysis workflows. In later stages of the project you will also design and conduct additional, custom validation experiments, which may involve different molecular biology techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) is a national center for molecular biosciences with focus on health and environmental research. The combination of the highly interdisciplinary expertise and research projects at the department is unique in Sweden and also at an international level. This expertise ranges across cell biology, biochemistry, biophysics and theory. Recently, the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program started the &lt;a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) program&lt;/a> in order to accelerate life science research through innovations in AI and data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AICell Lab (&lt;a href="https://aicell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aicell.io&lt;/a>) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and SciLifeLab is a new research group funded by the DDLS Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now seeking a postdoctoral researcher to develop AI-powered automated microscopy imaging systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of the project is to build a smart microscopy imaging farm for massive production of image data. It consists of multiple microscopes and fluidic systems, robotic arms, liquid handling robots and automatic incubators. The farm will be used for performing automated widefield/fluorescence imaging, long-term live cell imaging, tracking,  spatial-omics and multiplexing imaging. With the AI-powered control software, data are analyzed in real-time, augmented views are added on the fly. By generating feedback control signals to control the microscope, the software will automatically change field-of-views, illumination power and other experimental conditions in order to optimize the phototoxicity and capture rare events in live cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The candidate is expected to develop an integrated system with microscopes, fluidic control, robotic arms, as well as the control software. The project is a collaboration with our collaborator in the &lt;a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WASP program&lt;/a> and built on top of our prior work (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.28.424613v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squid&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0627-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ImJoy&lt;/a>) from us or our collaborators at Stanford University.&lt;/p>
